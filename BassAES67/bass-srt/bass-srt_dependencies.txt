Here's what needs to be installed on the deployment system: Required runtime dependencies for libbass_srt.so:

Library	Package (Ubuntu/Debian)	Purpose
libbass.so	(provided by you)	BASS audio library
libopus.so.0	libopus0	OPUS codec
libmpg123.so.0	libmpg123-0	MP2/MP3 decoder
libFLAC.so.8	libflac8	FLAC codec
libsrt-gnutls.so.1.4	libsrt1.4-gnutls	SRT transport
libtwolame.so	libtwolame0	MP2 encoder (not shown but used)
Install command (Ubuntu/Debian):

sudo apt install libopus0 libmpg123-0 libflac8 libsrt1.4-gnutls libtwolame0

The other libraries (gnutls, nettle, ogg, etc.) are transitive dependencies that come with SRT and FLAC. 
Nothing is statically linked - all codec libraries are dynamically loaded at runtime. 
This keeps the .so small but requires the dependencies to be installed. 
Want me to look into static linking options to reduce deployment dependencies? 
Or shall we proceed to SRT statistics?




# Ubuntu/Debian based
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libopus0 \
    libmpg123-0 \
    libflac8 \
    libsrt1.4-gnutls \
    libtwolame0 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

Or for Alpine (smaller image):
RUN apk add --no-cache opus mpg123 flac libsrt twolame
